# Simple Python Projects I made 
### At the time I write this I'm learning python and I uploaded some of the many programs I made in python.
###### By the way the QR code one I made with a tutorial the others way more alone
###### I just wanted to share my python projects
### Requirements : 
-Python3 \
Next run these commands and you will be ready to run all the programs \
```
git clone https://github.com/solitary8/python_projects 
cd python_projects
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
After this you can execute any program you want using : 
```
python3 example.py
```
### Don't execute grade_operations.py it will return nothing ! execute main_operations.py to get something !
### Nobody will ever read this but thanks for using the tool !
